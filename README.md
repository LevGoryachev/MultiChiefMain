# MultiChiefMain
<p><b>MultiChief</b> is an experimental microservice-based ERP system for construction industry (on-line and off-line interaction between departments and employees).<p/>
<b>MultiChiefMain</b> is a main project that is structured by project modules - services-orchestrators.
<p>Each service-orchestrator is intended for certain business function, responsible for preparing data
(DTOs, Views, BusinessEntities) for web-client (frontend module <a href="https://github.com/LevGoryachev/MultiChiefWeb">MultiChiefWeb</a>). </p>

  
<p><b>Summary: Java 11, Spring-Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)</b></p>
<p><b>Databases: PostgreSQL</b></p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Customized microservice-based domain-driven architecture that has levels:<p/>
<ul>
<li><b>Core sevices (atomic microservices).</b>
 Each one is responsible for a certain functions of its domain(CRUD operations of subdomains, preparing special DTOs)
 and does not interact with both other microservices and business-consumer-services. Depending on the necessity,
 other microservices (related to MultiChief or not) can be created and added to interaction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Composite/integration sevices (service-orchestrators).</b> Each one is responsible for a certain business-function.
 An orchestrator can use from one to many MultiChief microservices and also can use third-party web services to implement business-functionality. Depending on the necessity of business,
 additional MultiChief-service-orchestrators can be created and added to interaction.</li>
<li><b>Consumers (frontend module <a href="https://github.com/LevGoryachev/MultiChiefWeb">MultiChiefWeb</a>).</b>
Depending on the necessity, additional GUI modules can be added.</li>
</ul>
